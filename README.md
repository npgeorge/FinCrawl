# FinCrawl

FinCrawl was inspired by Chamath Palihapitiya's Twitter thread shown below. 
The TLDR version of the idea was to identify phases of market cycles by gathering financial data and sorting it into 6 categories.
The 6 categories are: Free Cash Flow, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation & Amortization), Revenue, 
ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), Multipe of Bookings, & GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).
